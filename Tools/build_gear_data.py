"""Extract the data behind the Gear Advisor and Gear Finder into GearData.lua.

    python3 Tools/build_gear_data.py --cmangos FILE --pfquest-turtle DIR --instancejournal DIR

Both need facts a 1.12 client will not give an addon, taken from the CMaNGOS
classic-db dump (FILE, .sql or .sql.gz) and pfQuest-turtle (DIR, a checkout)
and committed, so the addon reads them with no database:

  Sell prices   When no quest reward is an upgrade, the Gear Advisor picks
                the one worth most at a vendor, as Zygor's does. Every item a
                quest offers as a choice, with its SellPrice.
  Dungeon loot  What the Gear Finder looks through: for each dungeon and raid,
                what its creatures drop, with the chance -- groups and shared
                ("reference") loot tables resolved into one chance per item --
                and for each item its slot, quality, required level and the
                classes it is for. Only green and better gear, MIN_CHANCE or
                likelier; a shared table used by more than REF_LIMIT creatures
                is the world's random drops, not a dungeon's, and is left out.

The dungeons are found by map: the creatures spawned there (creature,
creature_spawn_entry). Map ids and names live in the client's Map.dbc, which
the dump does not carry, so INSTANCES names them -- with the level ranges the
first-time setup uses (SetupFrame.lua), and the usual ones for the rest. A
few bosses are summoned by a script rather than spawned, so appear on no map;
SUMMONED names them, and their loot is looked up like any other.

Turtle WoW's own dungeons and raids are not in that database; pfQuest-turtle
has them. TURTLE_INSTANCES names the zones it places their creatures in, and
what those creatures drop comes from its item data, with the chance. Their
levels are read off the creatures: the tenth percentile of the elites'
levels, to the highest, both held at 60 -- a creature above 60 is level-60
content. pfQuest-turtle knows an item's name and where it drops but not its
slot or quality, so Turtle's own items go in with no entry under `items`: the
finder asks the client what they are, as it asks for any item it has not
seen. Items the CMaNGOS database knows are filtered here as for any dungeon.
Only direct drops are taken: the shared tables Turtle's dungeons use are the
world's random drops, or pools of trash drops far under MIN_CHANCE.

Gear from quests, reputation and crafting (other_sources), for the finder
too -- at 60 much of the best gear is not a drop:

  Quests        every quest whose reward is gear: its title, the level it can
                be taken at, the side and classes it is for, and the
                reputation it needs, if any. Quests Turtle removed are left
                out; Turtle's own quests' rewards are in neither database.
  Reputation    gear a vendor sells only at a reputation rank (npc_vendor,
                and the vendor templates): the faction, the rank, the vendor.
  Crafted       gear a profession makes: the craft spell a recipe or a
                trainer teaches (spell_template's learn-spell effect) and
                the item it makes, with the profession, the skill it is
                learned at, and whether it binds on pickup -- which only
                matters to someone with the profession.

Faction names are not in the dump: FACTIONS names the ones that gate gear,
and the run fails on one it does not know, so none goes unnamed.

Turtle also changed the vanilla instances: bosses added, loot moved, drops
taken out. turtle_vanilla lays those over the CMaNGOS loot, from the same
pfQuest-turtle data (see its docstring for the rule).

Turtle's own quests are not in either. Their rewards have no price, and the
Gear Advisor says so rather than guess.
