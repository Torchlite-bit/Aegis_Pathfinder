"""Add the filter tags a person approved to the Optimized and zone guides.

    python3 Tools/apply_filter_tags.py                      # add them
    python3 Tools/apply_filter_tags.py --check              # report any missing
    python3 Tools/apply_filter_tags.py --pfquest DIR [DIR]  # recompute follow-ups first

Tools/find_filter_candidates.py lists the steps that probably want an |AH|,
|P|GROUP| or |D|<code>| tag into docs/review/filter_candidates.json; the
answers -- which of each item's suggested tags to add -- are in
docs/review/filter_decisions.json. A "yes" adds the tag; a "no" -- an answer
changed after the tags went in -- takes it off again; "steps" tags only the
steps shown that are not the quest's own (the "buy it on the Auction House"
note, not the quest you can also do by farming what it asks for).

What a "yes" covers depends on what the evidence was:

  * The quest itself -- one of its accept, kill, complete or turn-in steps:
    the tag goes on every step of that quest in the guides reviewed, as the
    review page promised, so a solo player never accepts a group quest they
    cannot finish.
  * Only a note, a run or a buy step that happens to carry a quest id ("Keep
    Pages", "Buy a Bronze Tube"): just the steps that were shown. The quest
    id there is incidental, and tagging the whole quest would hide one
    nobody reviewed.

A quest you can only pick up after a tagged one inherits its tag: with the
first hidden, nobody can accept the rest. Those follow-ups are worked out
from pfQuest's prerequisites (--pfquest: pfQuest's and pfQuest-turtle's
checkouts, or a folder of their db files with "/" as "_") and kept in the
decisions file with the quest they follow, so applying needs no database.

Each listed step is found by its line and checked against its title before
anything is written, so a guide edited since the review is reported rather
than tagged in the wrong place. Running it twice changes nothing.
