"""Write a guide for each dungeon: every quest for it, then the way in.

    python3 Tools/build/build_dungeon_guides.py --check          # fail if they are stale

A dungeon guide is picked from the guide list, not reached on a route. It
goes round the towns in DUNGEONS' order picking up every quest for the
dungeon -- and doing the quests before them that the towns on the way give
-- then puts the arrow on the entrance. Inside, it takes you through what
each quest wants and hands in what ends there; on the way back, the towns in
reverse, it hands in the rest and picks up what they lead to. A chain that
needs another visit -- a quest you are given only once you have handed one
in outside -- gets another run.

A quest whose chain starts somewhere the guide does not go -- a long chain in
another zone, another dungeon's quests -- is in the guide, but optional
(|O|) and offered once the quest before it is handed in (|PRE|): it shows for
a character who has done that, and sends nobody off to do it. Quests given
where the guide does not go at all are named in a note at the top.

Which quests belong to a dungeon is InstanceJournal's
(https://github.com/Arthur-Helias/InstanceJournal, public domain), a Turtle
WoW addon that lists every instance's quests, with each dungeon's levels and
entrance. The quests themselves -- who gives and takes them, what they ask
for and where, the quests before them -- are pfQuest's, with pfQuest-turtle
over them: The Kludge Bureau's fork
(https://github.com/The-Kludge-Bureau/pfQuest-turtle), which has patch
1.18.1's. SKIP, ADD, FIX, TASK and FAR correct what the data gets wrong.

Reading them takes a minute and all three checkouts, so what the guides are
written from is kept in Tools/data/dungeon_guides.json: --check, and a change
to DUNGEONS, need none of them.
