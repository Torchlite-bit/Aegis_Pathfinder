"""Talent builds for the Talent Advisor (Part 4), checked against Turtle WoW's
own trees, and written to Tools/data/talent_builds.json.

The trees are the game's: `/apg talents` saved them on a character of each
class (read_talent_trees.py took them out of the saved settings into
Tools/data/turtle_talent_trees.json). Turtle WoW has reworked every class,
so nothing here comes from the original game's trees.

  * A levelling build for every class: the order its points go in, one a
    level from 10, so that by 60 all 51 are spent.
  * A build at 60 for each of the class's three specs: the talents and their
    ranks, which is all a build at 60 needs, as the points are spent at once.

Every build is checked: talents the class has, no more ranks than a talent
has, 5 points in a tree for each row down, prerequisites at full rank before
the talent, and 51 points. A levelling build is checked point by point, in
its order, as the game would let it be learnt.

RestedXP's Classic levelling orders (import_rxp_talents.py) were the starting
point for the levelling builds, where Turtle WoW kept the talents they used;
the talents of theirs that Turtle WoW has no longer are listed with each
class.

  python3 Tools/build/talent_builds.py [--check]

With --check it writes nothing, and fails if a build has a problem or the
committed Tools/data/talent_builds.json is not what it would write.
