"""Write a guide for each class quest milestone: the Voidwalker, Bear Form,
the Felsteed, Rhok'delar -- one guide each, per side.

    python3 Tools/build/build_class_guides.py              # write Guides/Class/
    python3 Tools/build/build_class_guides.py --check      # fail if they are stale
    python3 Tools/build/build_class_guides.py --list       # the milestones, and each race's chain

                                                     # read the quest data again first

A milestone is a chain of class quests that ends in something the class
keeps: a spell or form (Summon Voidwalker, Bear Form, Redemption, a totem),
a mount (Felsteed, Warhorse, Dreadsteed, Charger) or a class item (the
Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe, Rhok'delar, Benediction). The raid tiers' armour
exchanges -- Zul'Gurub's Paragons of Power, Ahn'Qiraj's and Naxxramas'
sets, the dungeon set's upgrade and Turtle WoW's tier vendors -- are not
class quests in that sense, and are left out.

Chains are found from the data: pfQuest's "quests before", CMaNGOS'
NextQuestInChain and PrevQuestId. Chains that end in the same thing are one
milestone, and each race gets the chain that starts in its home city: an
Undead warlock's Voidwalker is Carendin Halgar's, in the Undercity; an Orc's
is Gan'rul Bloodeye's, in Orgrimmar. A quest that only sends you to the
chain -- "Heeding the Call", "Gan'rul's Summons" -- is optional (|O|): the
chain's first quest is given without it. A milestone with a group, dungeon
or raid quest in it is a group milestone: it is offered only in Group mode
(NextGuideFrame.lua), though its guide is in the list for anyone.

The guide itself is simple: each quest in order, picked up, done and handed
in, with the arrow on whoever gives it, the place its objectives are, and
whoever takes it back. A quest inside a dungeon or raid points at the way in.
What can be done where you are comes first -- a hand-in, then a pick-up --
and a quest that gives what another asks for is handed in before that one's
objectives. Each race's steps are merged into one guide, |R| on the ones not
every race takes; at the end of each file, RegisterClassMilestones tells the
offer each milestone's level, quests and last hand-in, per race.

Reading the data takes all three sources, so what the guides are written
from is kept in Tools/data/class_quests.json: --check needs none of them.
The data is pfQuest's (https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest), with The Kludge
Bureau's pfQuest-turtle (https://github.com/The-Kludge-Bureau/pfQuest-turtle)
over it for Turtle WoW's races and quests, and CMaNGOS classic-db's
quest_template for the chains, quest types and rewards.
