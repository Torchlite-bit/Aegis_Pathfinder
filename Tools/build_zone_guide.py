"""Write a custom zone's guide from a pfQuest-turtle checkout.

    python3 Tools/build_zone_guide.py --pfquest-turtle DIR --pfquest DIR
        [--zone "Moonwhisper Coast"] [--dump] [--check]

Reads the zone's quests out of pfQuest's data -- who gives each one, who takes
it back, what it asks for and where, the quests before it, the levels and the
races -- and writes a guide per side into Guides/<side>/, in the DSL of
docs/GUIDE_AUTHORING.md. --dump prints the quests instead; --check fails when
the committed guides differ from what it would write.

The route is worked out the way the authoring notes order a zone by hand:

  1. A quest's turn-in comes before any quest that needs it (["pre"]); its
     accept before its objectives before its turn-in.
  2. You arrive at the bottom of the range and leave at the top. The level
     climbs as quests are handed in, and a quest's objectives wait until you
     are within AHEAD levels of it.
  3. At a quest giver, everything that can be handed in and picked up there
     is, before moving on; then the nearest thing to do next -- a quest's
     objectives, a hand-in or a quest to pick up -- where a place with more to
     do there counts as nearer.
  4. A quest that sends you out of the zone and back waits until the zone has
     nothing left without it; everything else in that zone is done on the
     same trip. A quest that only ends outside the zone is picked up last and
     handed in on the way out -- or on a trip already going there.

What the data cannot give -- the names of places, which quest follows which
where the data has no ["pre"], where objectives are that it has no spawns
for, which quests want a group -- is in ZONES, under the zone, so that running
this again over a newer checkout keeps it. Anything the route still has no
place for is printed as it writes.

Moonwhisper Coast's data is ryanmr82's pfQuest-turtle fork
(https://github.com/ryanmr82/pfQuest-turtle), built from captures players send
in, and still growing: run this again over a newer checkout now and then.
pfQuest (https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest) is read for the NPCs outside the
zone that send you there and take quests back.
