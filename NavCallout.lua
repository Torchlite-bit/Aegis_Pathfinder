--[[ NavCallout.lua -- the concept's signature navigation arrow.

	An arrow pointing at the current objective, the instruction under it, and
	the distance and ETA under that. It has no panel behind it: the concept
	dropped the `background` and `box-shadow` this block used to carry, so it
	floats directly on the game world.

	That is why everything here is shadowed. Over snow, over Un'Goro grass, over
	a lit doorway, unshadowed text at these weights simply disappears; the
	concept's `text-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.9), 0 1px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.7)`
	is what makes it readable, and a 1.12 font string's SetShadowOffset /
	SetShadowColor is the closest equivalent. It is a single offset copy rather
	than a blur, so it is drawn at full opacity to carry the same weight.

	Drag it anywhere; the concept made the whole block a grab handle.
