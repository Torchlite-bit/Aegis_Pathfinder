	One recipe a line, ordered by the skill it turns orange at:

	  "<recipe> = <reagents> @ <orange>-<yellow>-<green>-<grey> | <learned> [| skip] [| nomake]"

	Reagents are joined by " + ", each with its count in front when that is
	more than one; "#<id>" is an item no database could name, which the game
	names once it has seen it. <learned> is how the recipe is learned:
	"trainer <copper>", "book <item> <copper>" or "book <item> ?", "quest",
	"drop" or "special"; a ~ marks an estimated cost. "skip" keeps a recipe
	out of routes (cooldowns, rare drops); "nomake" stops the planner making
	it to supply another recipe. Tools/import_recipes.py documents each.
