--[[
	CraftPlanner.lua -- the cheapest way to level a crafting profession.

	The profession guides say what to craft in each skill band, chosen once by
	whoever wrote them. That choice goes stale the moment prices move: the
	cheapest way through 125-150 on a server where Bronze Bars flood the
	auction house is not the cheapest where they don't. This works the route
	out again from current prices, whenever you ask.

	What it knows about each recipe (Crafting/*.lua, converted from CraftRoute
	by Tools/build/import_recipes.py): the skill at which it turns orange, yellow,
	green and grey, its reagents, how it is learned and roughly what that
	costs. What it knows about prices: what merchants charge (Crafting/
	Prices.lua), what the auction house asks (its own scan, CraftScan.lua, or
	Aegis: Exchange's), and what merchants pay for what you make.

	How the route is found:

	  1. Every reagent gets a unit cost: the merchant's price or the auction
	     house's, whichever is lower, or the cost of making it from its own
	     reagents when this profession can and that is cheaper still.
	  2. The chance that a craft raises your skill falls in a straight line
	     from certain at yellow to nothing at grey -- the rule as Blizzard
	     describe it. So one skill point with a recipe costs, on average, a
	     craft's cost divided by that chance.
	  3. The cheapest sequence is a shortest path through the skill points,
	     where the state is the recipe you used last: carrying on with it
	     costs the next point, switching to another costs that recipe's
	     learning fee as well (and, as a nudge against one-point detours,
	     one craft of it). That is a small dynamic program -- skill points
	     times recipes -- rather than a search.
	  4. Buying forty of something costs more than forty times its cheapest
	     listing. So the route is priced at the quantities it actually
	     buys, walking up the auction listings, and planned again at those
	     prices, until it stops changing.
	  5. The finished route is played through in order, as you would craft
	     it: what an earlier step made is used by a later one before
	     anything is bought, and what is left over at the end is sold back
	     to a merchant (if you let it).

	A reagent no one has a price for yet keeps its recipe out of the route,
	unless the route cannot go on without it; then it is used, and said to be
	unpriced, rather than pretending the route is cheaper than it is.
