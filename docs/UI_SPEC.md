# UI specification

How the design concept maps onto 1.12 frames. The concept is a web page; this
records what each part of it becomes in an addon that has no CSS, no rounded
rectangles, no web fonts and no emoji.

The concept itself is kept in `docs/design/` for reference. It is a design
artifact — it is not referenced from the `.toc` and does not ship.

## Design tokens

Every value below lives in `Theme.lua` and nowhere else. The hex strings are
the concept's CSS custom properties, kept verbatim so they can be diffed
against it.

| Concept | `Theme.color` | Hex | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--panel` | `panel` | `202020` | Window bodies |
| `--panel-2` | `panel2` | `111111` | Headers, footers |
| `--panel-3` | `panel3` | `1a1a1a` | In-town steps, inactive pills |
| `--tabbg` | `tabbg` | `3b3b3b` | Tab strips, nav rows |
| `--accent` | `accent` | `52c722` | Progress, active states, meta text |
| `--accent-deep` | `accentDeep` | `2e850e` | Gradient start, branch pill |
| `--accent-glow` | `accentGlow` | `8fe066` | Gradient end, pill text |
| `--gold` / `--gold-deep` | `gold` / `goldDeep` | `ffed71` / `e8b93a` | Branch tag |
| `--band-green` / `--band-red` | `bandGreen` / `bandRed` | `2e850e` / `7c1820` | Step bands |
| `--danger` | `danger` | `e8636b` | Errors |
| `--blue` | `blue` | `5b9fd6` | Wired-dungeon marker |
| `--text` / `--text-dim` | `text` / `textDim` | `ffffff` / `c7c7bd` | Text |
| `--border` | `border` | `050505` | 1px borders |
| — | `subtle` | `545454` | Unchecked control rings |

Fonts: Rajdhani (display) and Inter (body), bundled under `media/fonts/`.
`Theme:SetFont` falls back to the client font if a face is rejected, so a bad
TTF degrades to readable text rather than an empty UI.

## Techniques

**Rounded corners.** The client has no rounded-rect primitive. `Theme:NineSlice`
builds one from a 32×32 mask: four 10px corners at fixed size, four edges that
stretch along one axis, and a stretched centre, positioned with `SetTexCoord`.
`Theme.CORNER` and the slice constants must stay in step with the radius in
`Tools/build/make_assets.py`.

**Colour.** Shapes are white masks tinted with `SetVertexColor`, so one
rounded-rect serves every panel, tab, pill and band, and a palette change is a
Lua edit rather than a re-render.

**Shadows.** `box-shadow` becomes `shadow.tga`, nine-sliced 7px outside the
frame (`Theme.SHADOW_GEOM`: 18px corners, no middle piece). It is a ring:
darkest at the panel's edge, gone 7px out, and transparent inside. That last
part matters. The shadow shares the fill's `BACKGROUND` layer, and 1.12 does
not order two textures within a layer, so the first version -- a stretched
blob, darkest in its middle -- drew a dark square straight through the guide
panel. `Tools/verify.py` fails a shadow that is not clear in the middle.

**Icons.** The concept uses emoji, which the 1.12 font cannot render. Each of
the 17 action codes gets a generated 32×32 glyph instead. They are silhouettes,
not line art, because they render at roughly 14px where thin strokes vanish.

The frames index these by parsed action name (`ACCEPT`, `SETHEARTH`), not by
DSL letter, so `Theme.actionIconByName` is the table `AegisPathfinder.icons`
actually resolves through. Before that existed the panels were still drawing
stock quest-log art -- bevelled, bordered, a different palette -- on top of
the themed background.

**Chrome glyphs.** The concept draws its own chrome with characters the client
font has no glyph for: `☰ ✕ + ← → ‹ › ✓ ! 📍`. Each is generated the same way
and lives in `Theme.glyph`.

**Tooltips.** The concept's hints are the browser's `title` attribute; the
client's equivalent, `GameTooltip`, is Blizzard's bevelled card in FrizQuadrata
-- and shared with the whole UI, so restyling it would restyle every other
addon's tooltips too. `Theme:ShowTip(owner, side, text, detail, color)` is the
addon's own: a `panel-2` card in the body face, the hint in `--text` over dimmer
detail lines, as wide as its longest line up to 260px, in the `TOOLTIP` strata,
hiding itself if its owner disappears under the cursor. A window can ask for
its hints to open outside it, `Theme:TipOutside(window)`, and the guide does,
so a hint never covers its steps. Such a hint opens beside the window on the
side facing the middle of the screen, which has the more room, its top level
with what is hovered; with no room there, below the window when it is in the
top half of the screen and above it in the bottom half. It is placed in screen
pixels, so the guide's own scale does not move it. Only the Active Items
buttons still open `GameTooltip`, since only it can show a game item, and
`Tools/verify.py` fails any other file that does. Those buttons are the theme's
rounded tile around the item's icon, not `ItemButtonTemplate`'s square
action-button border.

**Gradients.** Baked into the texture (`progress-fill.tga`) — there is no
runtime gradient.

## Surfaces

### Navigation callout -- `NavCallout.lua`

The concept's signature element, and the only surface with no window around it:
`background` and `box-shadow` were dropped, so the arrow, the instruction and
the distance float directly on the game world.

That is what makes the text shadows load-bearing rather than decorative. The
concept sets `text-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.9), 0 1px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.7)`;
1.12 offers one hard offset copy through `SetShadowOffset` / `SetShadowColor`,
so it is drawn at full opacity to carry the same weight. Without it the
instruction disappears over snow.

**Rotation.** 1.12 has no `SetRotation`. The eight-argument form of
`SetTexCoord` maps a texture onto an arbitrary quad, which is how vanilla
addons turned minimap arrows, so `AegisPathfinder.RotateTexture` rotates the
four corners about (0.5, 0.5). The arrow art is centred in its square for the
same reason -- a rotation samples outside 0..1 at the corners, and off-centre
art wobbles as it turns.

**Bearing** comes from `AegisPathfinder:GetWaypointBearing` in
`Navigation.lua`, which is a compass bearing to the stored waypoint minus the
player's facing. Distance needs Astrolabe's zone dimension tables to turn map
percentages into yards; Astrolabe ships with both TomTom and pfQuest, so in
practice it is there whenever a provider is. When it is not, the arrow still
points and the distance stays blank -- an invented number would be worse.

With Astrolabe loaded -- TomTom-TWOW and pfQuest both bring it -- the bearing
and distance come from it: it measures in yards across the zones of a
continent, as TomTom's own arrow does, and copes with the hidden world map
being left on the continent view. Astrolabe does that itself when it cannot
place the player in a zone, and the same-zone path used to read it as "not in
the waypoint's zone" and hide, while TomTom's arrow kept pointing. Without
Astrolabe it falls back to that path (re-centring a continent-view map first).
A waypoint on a continent's own map -- zone 0, from RestedXP's "Travel to
Kalimdor" steps -- is measured by Astrolabe like any other; without it the
callout hides and `/apg diagnav` says the point is on the continent's map.
With no provider, no waypoint, or no way to measure, the callout hides; an
arrow that is confidently wrong is worse than no arrow. `/apg diagnav` says
which of those it is.

**Which arrows.** Out of the box there were two: ours, and the waypoint
addon's, aimed at the same waypoint. Ours reads the waypoint the addon records
for itself, not the provider's arrow, so they are independent, and the options
panel's **Arrows** section has a switch for each of Pathfinder's, TomTom's and
pfQuest's, any combination (`IsArrowOn` / `SetArrow` in `Navigation.lua`). An
arrow that is on gets the step's waypoint even when its addon is not the one
taking them, so TomTom's and pfQuest's can both point. pfQuest's switch reads
and writes pfQuest's own `pfQuest_config.arrow` (what `/db arrow` flips), and
hides `pfQuest.route.arrow` when turned off. An addon not loaded has its switch
held off. The default is ours alone; a character who had turned ours off keeps
TomTom's. TomTom is told `crazy = false` outright -- TomTom-TWOW fills a nil `crazy`
from its own autoqueue setting, which is on -- and pfQuest's route target is
simply not set. That is not enough for TomTom on its own: its
`GoToNextWayPoint`, run when its arrow's target is reached or cleared, hands
the arrow to the last waypoint in its list, usually ours. So the arrow's
driver takes TomTom's arrow back off any of *our* waypoints each tick while
the setting says so (`EnforceArrowMode`); the player's own TomTom waypoints
are never touched. Cartographer and MetaMap BWP have no waypoint but their arrow,
so they point whatever is switched, and the section's note says so.

### The status card -- deleted

The concept removed it: every `.sb-*` rule and the whole `#statusbar` block are
gone, and `renderStatusBar()` became `renderNavCallout()`. `StatusFrame.lua`
went with it.

Almost nothing in that file was the card, though. `UpdateStatusFrame` is the
scan that walks the step list, decides which step you are on, auto-completes
what ClassicAPI can resolve, drives the waypoint and loads the next guide when
one runs out. That is now `GuideEngine.lua`. The use-item button for `|U|`
steps lived there too until it became the Active Items window
(`ActiveFrames.lua`, below).

What the card's meta row used to paint is now `GetStepMeta`, which returns the
quest id, a profession step's live skill range, coordinates buried in the note,
and any warning, and lets the caller decide how to show them.

### Window chrome -- `Theme:Chrome`

Every floating window in the concept is the same `.chrome-frame`, so one call
builds all of it:

| Concept element | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `.panel-header` | `Theme:Header` -- a `panel-2` strip, the wordmark centred, a 1px rule beneath |
| `.panel-wordmark` | `wordmark.tga`, not a font string: the concept sets `.18em` letter-spacing, which 1.12 font strings cannot do |
| `.chip-btn` | `Theme:ChipButton` -- a 20px rounded square carrying one glyph |
| `.subhead` | `Theme:Subhead` -- a `tabbg` strip naming the window in small uppercase |
| `cursor:grab` on the header | `MakeDragHandle`: `SetMovable` + `RegisterForDrag`, with the drop position saved per profile |

The header's corners are a problem the concept does not have. It clips its
strips to the window radius with `overflow:hidden`; 1.12 cannot clip, so a
flat strip across the top of a rounded panel pokes square corners out past it.
`Theme:CapStrip` nine-slices `cap-top.tga` / `cap-bottom.tga` instead --
rounded on the edge that meets the panel, square on the edge that meets the
body.

A window that has been dragged stays where it was put: `Theme:PositionSaver`
records the drop, `Theme:RestorePosition` re-applies it, and the "snap beside
the status card" logic in each panel's `OnShow` only runs when nothing was
saved.

**Stacking.** The concept's windows are DOM elements, and one simply paints
over another. 1.12 draws a whole strata in frame-level order, across every
window at once, and a frame starts one level above its parent -- so two
windows built at the same level have their headers at the same level, their
chips at the same level, and so on down. Overlap them and they interleave:
one window's close chip and scrollbar drawn through the other's body.

`Theme:RegisterWindow` (which `Theme:Chrome` calls, and the objectives panel
calls itself) keeps the windows in bands instead. Showing a window, or
grabbing its header, moves its whole frame tree above every other open
window's, preserving each frame's height within its own window, and packs the
rest back down beneath it from a fixed base -- so levels are rebuilt rather
than raised, and never climb toward the client's ceiling. `SetToplevel` covers
clicks on a window's rows and buttons, where the client raises the window
itself; the order it leaves is read back from the roots' levels on the next
restack. `Tools/verify.py` fails a file that puts more windows in `DIALOG`
than it registers.

### Objectives panel -- `ObjectivesFrame.lua`

The concept's `#objectives`, and now the addon's only window: header, tab bar,
nav row, a 4px progress rule, the step list, and the footer.

**Escape does not close it.** It is not in `UISpecialFrames`: it stays on
screen while you play, as the quest tracker does, and Escape is what clears a
target or cancels a spell in a fight, so it kept closing the guide in combat.
Its close chip closes it. The windows opened from it (options, guide browser,
Where next?) still close on Escape, as does the character panel the Gear
Finder is a tab of.

**The ≡ menu**, Zygor's: the header's first chip opens it under itself, in
`FULLSCREEN_DIALOG` above every window -- **Guide menu** (the guide browser),
**Setup wizard**, **Lock window** (no drag, no grip), **Transparency** (the
panel's body at half strength, no shadow), **Reset window**, **Reload** and
**Settings**. The two switches are ticked boxes and saved per profile; any
other item closes the menu, and so does Escape. Find NPC is for later.

**Panels open beside the guide, not instead of it.** The ☰ chip used to hide
the panel before showing Config, so opening settings closed what you were
reading; the concept has `#options` at `right:456px` and `#objectives` at
`right:40px`, both on screen. Same for the menu's items, the `+` and the guide
browser.

**Two modes**, behind the header's third chip. Focus -- the default -- shows
the one step you are on and nothing else, which is how you follow a guide;
overview shows the whole list, which is how you look ahead. The chip takes
`.chip-btn.active` (accent fill, dark glyph) while overview is on, so the panel
says which of the two you are looking at.

**The objective meter** (`.zobjective`) sits under the single step in focus
mode: what the quest wants, how much of it you have, and a bar. It is quest-log
leaderboard text -- "Kobold Vermin slain: 3/8" -- parsed into its three parts.
An objective with nothing countable in it ("Speak to Marshal Dughan") gets no
meter rather than an empty one. **Substitution:** the concept draws one
objective; a quest with more has a line each (`PaintMeter`), label, count and
bar stacked 8px apart, and the meter grows a line at a time from the
concept's 38px -- Crocolisk Hunting's meat and skins are two bars. A finished
objective stays, its bar full. A bar is a StatusBar (`Theme:ProgressBar`):
the client fills it to the value, where a texture sized from the bar's
reported width drew 4 of 5 about half full in game. The step's accent bar and
wash reach down beside the meter to the footer (`ReachActiveRow`), so the
objectives read as part of the step.
Overview mode folds the same text into the step's note line instead, as the
concept does.

**Width.** The concept's 396px (`.panel{width:396px}`). It used to open at
630px, and every earlier version saved the width on any resize, the first
layout included -- so a stored 630 is read as "never chosen" and dropped. Only
the grip saves a width now. At 396 a warning in the footer does
not fit beside the step count, so it stops short of the count on one line and
the footer's tooltip carries the whole of it.

**Height follows the content.** The concept's panel is `height:auto` under
`max-height: min(70vh, 600px)`, with `.steps-list` `flex:0 0 auto` in focus
mode and `flex:1 1 auto` in overview. So `LayoutPanelHeight` makes the panel
exactly as tall as what it shows, up to a cap: in focus mode, the one step
(its title and its note in full, both wrapped to the width) and the meter;
in overview, the list, one line of title a step, which for any
real guide means the cap. The height is never saved -- only the width and the
cap are the player's.

The resize grip is the concept's `makeResizable`: sideways sets the width
(320px minimum), down or up sets the cap (260px minimum), never the height.
It does its own sizing from `GetCursorPosition` rather than `StartSizing`. The
client's sizing re-anchors the frame as it sees fit, and a panel left anchored
by its top and its bottom ignores `SetHeight`, which is how the panel once got
stuck at a dragged size, unable to follow the step or be moved. A height
saved by that older version becomes the cap.

Every window is pinned by its top-left corner after a drag (`Theme:AnchorTopLeft`),
so it grows downward and has one anchor to save, and `PositionSaver` keeps the
relative point as well as the offsets. Windows are clamped to the screen.
`/apg resetpanels` forgets every saved position and size.

**The footer** carries live state rather than the slash-command hint it used
to: the current step's quest id on the left in accent, how far through the
guide you are on the right. A warning from `GetStepMeta` outranks the id and
turns the slot red; nothing raises one at present (the per-server guide-data
warning is gone).

Rows are 44px slots holding either of the concept's two row models:

| Concept | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `.zrow` | Dot, action glyph, title, and the note beneath it in `#8f8f86` |
| `.zrow.active` | A faint wash plus the left accent bar |
| `.zrow.done` | Dimmed |
| `.zband.red` / `.zband.green` | `Theme:Band` laid over the whole slot |

A step becomes a band only when it is an `ACCEPT` or `TURNIN` **and** is either
the current step or already satisfied -- the same rule as the concept's
`bandable && (st.done || idx === state.stepIndex)`. Any other quest hand-off
further down the list stays an ordinary row, so the list does not turn into a
wall of colour.

In overview the slots are a fixed height rather than the concept's
content-height rows: these guides run to a few hundred steps and the list
scrolls by step, which needs a row height known in advance, so title and note
are clipped to one line each and the full note is in the row's tooltip. Focus
mode shows one step and has the room, so its row grows to show the whole note
(a second, wrapping font string, measured after it is set), and runs to the
panel's edge since there is no scrollbar beside it.

### Shared widgets

`Theme:StepCheck` is the step circle, a CheckButton, so `SetChecked` /
`GetChecked` / `OnClick` work as on any check button. `Theme:PanelButton` and
`Theme:CloseChip` are the buttons every secondary panel and the `Core.lua`
dialogs are built from, and `Theme:FadeIn` fades a window in as it opens.

### Options panel -- `OptionsFrame.lua`

The concept's `#options`: header and `Config` subhead over a body of sections —
Race, Route pack, Dungeons, Filters, Server theme — each an accent uppercase
`h3` over its controls. It used to be a column of pill buttons that opened the
dungeons, the filters and the route picker as three more windows; all of that
is sections now.

**Substitution: pages.** With the gear, behaviour, navigation and maintenance
sections added, one scrolling body grew too long to find anything in, so the
sections are grouped into pages with a category list down the left, as Zygor's
options have it: Route (Race, Route pack), Dungeons (Dungeons, Turtle WoW's
own, Along the way -- with the middle-of-its-levels switch -- and Boss notes,
whose *My role in dungeons* dropdown picks the boss steps' role lines), Filters, then
Zygor's pages in this style -- Appearance (Server theme, Window scale, Guide
window, Minimap), Step Display (Between guides, Sync & Share), Automation
(Quests, Travel, Inventory), Action Buttons (Windows), Navigation (Waypoints, Arrows),
Maps (World map, Ant trail, Points of interest) -- then
Gear and, set in under it, Item Score, then Extras (Chat, Level-ups), Maintenance, About. Automation replaced
Behaviour, whose switches went to Step Display, Automation, Action Buttons and
Appearance with their saved values. The pages built out of `CreateConfigPanel`
(`Build.*`) take its layout helpers as a kit, which keeps that function inside
Lua 5.0's limits. The concept's 396px pane is unchanged, with the 150px list beside it
(546px in all). The list is a quieter column than the pane — a 3% text tint and
a hairline on its right edge — and the page shown is marked with a 3px accent
bar, a brighter row and white text. The subhead names the page (`CONFIG ·
GEAR`). A page scrolls only when it is taller than the window, and every page
opens at its top; changing page closes any dropdown list left open.

A switch that belongs to the one above it -- *All quests* and *Pick the
guide's quest from an NPC's list* under accepting the guide's quests -- sits
24px in under it, stops at the same right edge, and is held off (45% alpha,
not clickable) while that one is off. A dropdown with a name, *Repair
automatically*, has it as a 13px body line above it.

**Sliders** written as percentages (`Build.Slider`): the guide window's
opacity, set in 24px under Transparency and held off (45% alpha, not
draggable) while it is off; the guide browser's opacity; the step text size.

**The guide window with the Appearance and Step Display settings.** Opacity
tints only the panel's fill, so the text stays solid; the browser's opacity is
the whole window's alpha, which its fade-in now stops at (`frame.fadeTo`).
Step text size scales the titles (12px base), notes (11px), the band labels
and the row height (44px) together. With the progress bar off the chrome is
82px instead of 86px and everything hung from it moves up. Growing upward pins
the panel by its bottom-left corner, as it is saved when dragged. In focus
mode, the steps after the current one (up to four more) sit under its meter
and party block, each its full height.

**Boxes to a row.** The Gear page's Upgrade sources and the Action Buttons
page's *Buttons to show* are both `Theme:Checkbox` grids under a 13px label,
two to a row 170px apart (`Build.Boxes`). *Active items grow* and *Active
targets grow* are named dropdowns (Right, Left, Up, Down); *Button size* a
`Theme:Slider`, 60% to 150%, applied as a scale factor on top of the window
scale (`Theme:SetScaleFactor`).

**The Maps page.** The trail's *Style* (Dots, Dashes) is a short dropdown,
140px, with its 13px label beside it, set 24px in under the trail's switch and
held off with it like a slider (`Build.ProfileDropdown`, `Build.Hold`). *Icon
size*, 60% to 160%, and *See-through icons* sit in under the rares' switch the
same way.

**The Extras page.** Two switches under Chat, each with its note; under
Level-ups, *Announce level-ups to:* as a `Build.Boxes` grid of three boxes
(Emote, Party chat / Guild chat). Emote is ticked until unticked; Party chat
and Guild chat are the first boxes off until ticked (`true` as a box's third
field). Under Talent Advisor: its switch (`Build.CharSwitch`, on until
switched off); *Build to follow*, a full-width dropdown (`Build.CharDropdown`)
dimmed to 45% and not clickable while the advisor is off, its items rebuilt on
every refresh so the first names your spec; a note; *Name the talent to take
in chat when I level up* and *Point out a talent point* set in under the switch
and held off with it; a note on Modern Spellbook; and an *Open the talent
window* pill (170 by 26). The reputation line is an ordinary
chat line from the addon, after the client's own.

**The talent window** (`TalentWindow.lua`) is Blizzard's own, loaded on demand
(Blizzard_TalentUI), and the advisor only lays marks over it. Its functions
are called by name -- `TalentFrame_Update` on showing, a tab clicked and points
spent, `TalentFrame_OnShow` on showing -- so each is wrapped where it is kept,
once, when Blizzard_TalentUI loads (`ADDON_LOADED`, or at once if another
addon loaded it first); `GameTooltip.SetTalent` is wrapped the same way, as
Pathfinder loads, for the tooltip line.

- *The strip*: a frame on `TalentFrame`, above its art (12 in from the left,
  34 from the right, its bottom 10 under the frame's top) or on pfUI's
  `TalentFrame.backdrop`, its width; `panel2` with rounded top corners
  (`CapStrip`). PATHFINDER in the display face (12, `accentGlow`) and
  *Following* (12, `textDim`), then a full-width `Theme:Dropdown` (the mock-up
  had it beside *Following*; the frame is too narrow there for the builds'
  names, so it has a row of its own). Under it the card for the next point,
  44 high: a dark gold ground (`#2e2a1c`), the talent's icon (36, trimmed) in
  a 2px gold (`#ffd100`) edge, its title (body, 14, gold) and a line under it
  (body, 12, `#e8e2c8`). With no next point, the line (12, white) in its
  place; the warning (11, amber `#f0b43c`) under either. 116 high with the
  card, 134 with the warning too; 86 and 104 with the line.
- *A badge* on each talent button: 16 high, pill-shaped (`pillFill` and
  `pillBorder`, 8px corners), centred on the button's top right corner (its
  rank is at the bottom right), the display face at 11. *todo*: `accent`
  fill and edge, near-black text; *done*: grey (`#5a5a5a`) with a white
  `tick` glyph, 10 square, in place of the number; *off*: amber fill and
  edge, dark text.
- *The next point*: `UI-ActionButton-Border`, 72 square, additive, tinted
  gold, over the button; and a 40 by 14 gold tag reading NEXT (display face,
  10, near-black) 3 above it.
- *The tab*: a gold `circleFill`, 8 square, left of the tab's name, and the
  tab lit with `UI-Character-Tab-Highlight`, additive, tinted gold.
- *The card on a level up*: 340 wide, `DIALOG` strata, 24 in from the right
  and 150 up from the bottom of the screen, a `panel` with its shadow,
  registered with the window stacking. The talent's icon (40) in a gold edge;
  "Level N: a talent point" (display, 15, gold); the talent to take (body, 13);
  *Open talents* (an active pill, 110 by 24) and *Later* (70 by 24). It hides
  after 30 seconds, on either button, and when a talent window opens.
- *The talents button*: on `TalentMicroButton`, `UI-ActionButton-Border`
  additive and gold, 2.4 times its width; a 16 square gold pill at its top
  right with the points to spend (display, 10, near-black).

**Modern Spellbook's talent window** (`TalentModern.lua`) is its own
`TalentTree` (frame `ModernTalentTreeFrame`), made when it loads; the advisor
lays the same marks over it. Its `Refresh`, which it calls on opening, a point
spent, a plan changed and a tree expanded, is wrapped on that window once, when
it loads (`ADDON_LOADED` for ModernSpellBook, or `PLAYER_LOGIN`); its frame's
OnShow and OnHide are chained.

- *The strip*: 60 high, 10 above its frame, as wide as it, a `panel` without a
  shadow. PATHFINDER (display, 14, `accentGlow`), a 1px rule, *Following* (11,
  `textDim`) over a 260 by 24 `Theme:Dropdown`, the card (330 by 46, the icon
  30), and at the right *Plan to my level* (active pill, 140), *Whole build as
  a plan* (180) and *Share* (80), 30 high. The plan buttons dim to 45% without
  its plans; all three while the build doesn't fit.
- *The marks*: the badge, ring (62 square) and NEXT of Blizzard's window, on
  each icon's frame, centred on its `border_frame`, five levels up. A gold
  pill, 16 high, reading NEXT POINT HERE (display, 10), right of the next
  point's tree's header. None while it shows a plan.
- *Share and plan*: 560 by 340, `DIALOG` strata, a `panel` with its shadow
  and a 40 high header (title SHARE AND PLAN, display 16; a close chip),
  dragged by its header, closed by Escape and by its window closing. The
  share string in a field (28 high, a hairline edge on black) that can't be
  typed over; *Follow a shared build* with a field and *Follow it* (100), its
  answer under it (`accentGlow`, or amber); *Plan to my level · N points*
  (active) and *Whole build · N points*, 34 high, side by side.

**On the world map** (`Maps.lua`) everything is drawn on the zone's own map,
1002 by 668 like the client's. The unexplored overlays are tiles of our own on
`WorldMapDetailFrame`, cut as the client cuts the explored ones (256px tiles,
the last of a row or column in the next power of two up) and tinted to 55%
grey. The step's places are pins on `WorldMapButton`: the accept, turn-in and
note icons, 14px, in gold (gold, gold, accent), for the quest giver, the
hand-in and the note's place; 7px filled circles for kill spots (danger) and
the creatures that drop the item (gold); at most 60 in all, 25 of them kill
spots. A pin names itself in the theme's tooltip. The trail is 5px accent
circles 14px apart -- dashes are 4px circles 4px apart, three on and three off
-- moving a gap toward the waypoint every 1.2 seconds, redrawn ten times a
second while the map is open. The minimap trail is eight 4px accent circles
placed by Astrolabe, reaching 85% of the way to the minimap's edge or to the
waypoint, whichever is nearer. A rare is the kill icon, 16px times *Icon
size*, gold (a rare elite in the danger colour), at half alpha when
see-through.

**The Active Items and Active Targets windows** lay their tiles out the way
each grows: a row from the left (right) or the right (left), or a column from
the top (down) or the bottom (up), 32px tiles 4px apart. Dragged, a window is
pinned by the corner it grows from -- top left, top right or bottom left -- so
it grows away from where you left it. The delete tile wears the cheapest
item's icon with a `close` glyph in the danger colour at its corner and a
danger border on hover; its question is a small themed window ("Make room")
with **Delete** and **Keep it**.

**The Sell greys button** (`Automation.lua`) is a `Theme:PanelButton`, 92 by
20, on the client's vendor window: at its top right, 44px in and 44px down,
clear of the title and the item grid, five levels over the window. It is the
one control of ours on a Blizzard window besides the Gear Finder's tab, and
it wears the theme, not Blizzard's button art.

A grip in the bottom-right corner (the guide's `grip.tga`) resizes the window:
wider or taller, never narrower than it opens, never shorter than 360px, never
bigger than the screen, and the size is kept. The pane's contents are laid out
for its width once, and each widget that spans it -- section rules, switches,
fine print, dropdowns and their lists, the route preview, the Item Score
page's share column -- is registered with how to take a new width, so a wider
window reflows them; a taller one shows more of the page before it scrolls.
Every row on a page is placed through one helper that remembers it, so a new
width lays the page out again: a label that no longer wraps gives its line
back, and the rows under it move up.

A switch's label wraps under itself when it is too long for the row, and the
row grows to hold it (`Switch:Fit`): the lines are counted from the label's
unwrapped width, since a wrapped font string's own height is not reliable on
1.12. Labels used to run under the scroll bar and be cut off.

**Checkboxes** (`Theme:Checkbox`) are for a few choices side by side that are
each on or off, where a column of switches would read as one list: the Gear
page's **Upgrade sources** -- **Dungeons** and **Raids**, as Zygor lays out its
dungeon and raid sources, then **Quest rewards**, **Reputation vendors** and
**Crafted gear** -- two to a row, 170px apart, three rows. Off, an outlined box; on, a box in the theme's
switchOn colour with a tick. They hold off with the Gear Finder, as its
switches do.

**Item Score** (`GearFrame.lua`) is Zygor's page of the same name: the spec
picker and your class, a note on where the spec came from and whether the
weights are the defaults or yours, *Show all stats*, then the weights one to a
row down the left — label (134px, so the longest stat names stay on one line),
then a 58px field (black, with a hairline edge) —
and beside them a *Share weights* column: the OctoPawn string's field with
**Import** and **Export** under it, and what they did. **Reset** sits under the
longer column. The list's length follows the spec and *Show all stats*, so the
page sets its own height as it is drawn and the window keeps your place while
it changes. It used to be a window of its own. Zygor's has a many-line box for
the string; here the field is one line that scrolls sideways, so the page
needs no second scroll frame inside its own.

| Concept | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `.options-body h3` | `Theme:SectionHeader` — 12px display, accent, 1px rule under it |
| `<select>` | `Theme:Dropdown` — a button with a caret, and a list at `FULLSCREEN_DIALOG` strata so the scrolling body cannot draw over it |
| `.pill-group` | `Theme:Pill`, sized to its label and wrapping |
| `.route-preview` | Level range in accent, zone in dim, one row per leg of the route this race takes under the selected pack; scrolls on the wheel. **Substitution:** the concept's seven rows are the least; the preview takes the rest of the page's height, a row per 20px, so a taller window shows more legs (`FitRoutePreview`) |
| `.dchip` grid | `Theme:Chip`, four across |
| `.toggle-row` + `.switch` | `Theme:Switch` — `switch-track.tga` (a stadium) and a circle knob that slides from left to right. Off: a faint track (`text` at 10%) and a white knob. On: the theme's `switchOn` (its accent deep; RavenCraft's a near white, where grey on grey did not say which it was) and a near-black knob. **Red and green switches** on the Appearance page (`Theme:SetSwitchColours("redgreen")`, saved as `switchcolours`) makes every switch green when on and red when off whatever the theme (`Theme.SWITCH_ON` / `SWITCH_OFF`), repainting those already drawn |
| `.fine-print` | `Theme:FinePrint` |
| `overflow-y:auto` | A ScrollFrame, the theme's scroll bar, and the wheel anywhere on the panel; the bar hides on a page that fits |

**Substitutions.** The concept has no home for the addon's own behaviour
settings, the item score and gear, the waypoint provider or the Rescan / Error
log actions, so they follow as more sections in the same language. Last comes
**About**, with
a **Credits** button that opens the credits as a window of their own -- the
same chrome and section layout as this panel, beside it on the side away from
the guide, closing when the options panel does. Credits used to be a slash
command that printed into chat. The concept's route pills
include a "Zone Completion" pack that the addon does not have; the pills are
the packs this character can actually use. The pack stored as `VanillaGuide`
is shown as "Optimized", the concept's name for it — only the display name
changed, since the key is saved on every character.

**The dungeon grid's blue dot is not decorative.** `AegisPathfinder:GetGuideDungeons` scans the
**raw** guide text for `|D|` tags and marks the dungeons the loaded guide
actually has steps for, so the grid distinguishes "I could run this" from
"this guide knows about it". It has to read raw text because the `|D|` filter
runs at parse time -- a step for a dungeon you have not opted into is gone
from `self.actions` entirely, so the parsed guide cannot answer the question.
A negated tag (`|D|!DM|`) still counts as a reference: the step is
conditional, the relevance is not. Results are cached per guide, since the
scan walks guides that run to hundreds of steps.

### Sharing a guide -- `PartySync.lua`

Not in the concept. Zygor's Share Mode, in this addon's language:

- **The party icon** (`Theme:GlyphButton` with the generated `party` glyph)
  sits at the right end of the objectives panel's step row, and the step count
  moves left of it. Dim while not sharing, gold while waiting for anyone to
  accept, the accent once someone has. Its tooltip says what sharing does, or
  who you are sharing with.
- **Confirmation** and **invitation** share one themed popup (header, `GUIDE
  SHARING (BETA)` subhead, centred lines, two half-width buttons). The
  confirmation names the guide, notes that the party needs Aegis: Pathfinder,
  and has a "Don't warn me again" box (`char.sharenowarn`). The invitation names
  who and which guide, and says accepting opens it in a new tab. Closing an
  invitation any way but Accept declines it.
- **Members under the step**: in focus mode, a block under the meter (or the
  step, with no meter), counted into the panel's height: a line per member,
  name left and status right — `[3/6]` (gold) or `[done]` (accent) on your step,
  `step N, behind` (gold), `step N` or `step N, waiting` ahead, `on a step you do
  not have`, `joining...`. A held step adds a first line, "Done. Waiting for your
  party to finish this step."
- **Holding**: `UpdateStatusFrame` asks `ShareHold` after finding the next
  step. A member on step p allows up to p, or p + 1 once they have finished p;
  past the smallest such limit you stay on the step you were on (never going
  back). The skip arrow on a held step bypasses it until the party passes it.
- **Messages**: over `PARTY` or `RAID`, prefix `AegisPF`, fields joined by `^`:
  `INV`, `ACC`, `DEC`, `NOG`, `ST` (step, done, have, need), `REQ`, `BYE`. A
  step is `action:questid-or-title#occurrence`, so class and race filtering do
  not misalign it. Our status is looked at twice a second and sent on change
  (at most once a second) or every 15 seconds; incoming news sets a dirty flag
  flushed once a frame, so a burst of messages is one engine run.

### Server themes -- `Theme.lua`

Not in the concept, which is green. The options panel's **Server theme**
(which replaced the Server dropdown) picks one of `Theme.THEMES`: Day, Night,
Turtle WoW (the concept, the default), OctoWoW, RavenCraft, Capybara Paradise,
Aegis. A theme names only the colours it changes: the accent family (`accent`,
`accentDeep`, `accentGlow`), and for Day, Night and RavenCraft the panel shades.
Text, gold, danger and the green/red step bands keep their meaning everywhere.

- **Live**: `Theme:ApplyTheme` changes the colour tables in place and re-tints
  every texture and font string `Tint`/`TextColor` last coloured by a name that
  some theme changes (a weak-keyed record, so nothing is kept alive by it).
  `SetTheme` then repaints the open windows, so colours chosen by state catch
  up. The saved theme is applied in `OnInitialize`, before the first paint.
- **Baked art**: the navigation arrow and progress fill are gradients drawn in
  green. `Theme:Skin` keeps them exactly as drawn under Turtle WoW, and under
  any other theme swaps in the same shape in grey (`nav-arrow-mask`,
  `progress-mask`), tinted with the theme's accent glow.
- **Readable**: `test_theme.lua` requires, in every theme, a WCAG contrast of
  4.5:1 for the accent on the panel and for dark text on an accent pill, and
  7:1 for dim text on the panel. RavenCraft's "dark grey" is its panels; its
  accent is a lighter grey, since dark grey on a dark panel cannot be read.
- **Colours only**: a theme says nothing about which server you play on. The
  servers share the quests and places the guides use, so the old per-server
  guide-data warnings (`Servers.lua`, `/apg server`) are gone; the note under
  the dropdown says what the theme looks like.

### Minimap button -- `MinimapButton.lua`

Not in the concept, which has no minimap. It is the addon's own:
`minimap-logo.tga`, the Aegis: Pathfinder logo on its dark disc with a red and
gold rune ring, so it needs no border; hovering puts an accent ring
(`circle-border.tga`) round it. It is 26px across: a stock minimap button is
a 30px gold ring round a 20px icon, and the logo, a solid disc, stood out as
bigger than the rest at 32.

Click toggles the guide, right-click toggles the options panel, and dragging
walks it round the minimap's edge at 80px from its centre; the angle is saved
per profile. "Minimap button" on the options panel's Appearance page,
or `/apg minimapbutton`, hides it. `Tools/verify.py` fails on Blizzard
quest-log or minimap art, in either backslash form.

### Gear Finder tab -- `GearFinderTab.lua`, `GearFinder.lua`

Not in the concept, which has no character panel: Zygor's Gear Finder, in the
addon's language. **A tab on the client's character panel**, after its own
(Character, Pet, Reputation, Skills, Honor): `CharacterFrameTab6` -- the
first free number, as the client's PanelTemplates walk the tabs by number --
from the client's `CharacterFrameTabButtonTemplate`, so it looks like its
neighbours. It is placed after the last tab shown, which moves as the Pet tab
comes and goes, at the gap the tabs before it keep (Blizzard's -16 overlap,
or a skin's spacing); under pfUI it is skinned with pfUI's `SkinTab`, as pfUI
skins tabs one to five. Its page is one of `CHARACTERFRAME_SUBFRAMES`, so the
client's own `ToggleCharacter` swaps it with the other pages and closing it
closes the panel. The tab is the one Blizzard-looking control the addon
makes, there because it sits in Blizzard's row.

**The page** is 714 wide, over the character panel's frame (or pfUI's
backdrop of it) down to where its tabs hang, and running past the panel to
the right. Header: GEAR FINDER and the character's level, race and class,
and a close chip; the panel's own close button, which would sit over the
header, is hidden while the page shows. Footer: where it looked, and a cog
that opens the options at the Gear page. Dragging the page moves the
character panel it hangs from, as pfUI lets you drag the panel's other
pages.

- **Cells**, 227 by 41 in two columns of eight -- Head, Neck, Shoulder, Back,
  Chest, Wrist, Main hand, Off hand; Hands, Waist, Legs, Feet, Finger 1 and
  2, Trinket 1 and 2 -- and Ranged under the suggested dungeon. The item's
  icon in a 1px frame of its quality's colour, its name in that colour, where
  it comes from in grey (in the accent when it drops in the dungeon on the
  right), *at level N* in gold; the gain in the display face, and *YOUR PICK*
  under it. Text stops short of what is beside it and ends in "..." rather
  than wrapping. An empty slot: the client's empty-slot picture, dimmed, and
  *No upgrade found*.
- **A slot's list**, opened from its cell, beside it over the other column
  (over the left one for the ranged cell), kept inside the page: up to eight
  rows, the wheel for more, the one shown marked *Biggest* or *Your pick*,
  and **Clear my pick**.
- **The suggested dungeon**, 222 wide: the loading screen
  (`pic:SetDungeon`, GuidePictures.lua), *Scoring for* and a spec dropdown,
  SUGGESTED DUNGEON, the name between arrows, its levels, *N upgrades here*,
  the slots, *1 of N*, and **Open the guide** in the accent, hidden for a
  dungeon with no guide. With nothing to suggest: the logo in the loading
  screen's place, the spec row still there to switch back, and why under it.

### Guide browser -- `GuideListFrame.lua`, `GuideBrowser.lua`, `GuidePictures.lua`

Not in the concept, which has a flat list: laid out like Zygor's guide menu,
on the owner's call and to the mockup they signed off. An 880x560 Chrome
window (820x520 to 1280x860 by the grip, saved per profile), in three
columns under the header:

- **Header.** HOME, CURRENT and RECENT on the left in the display face, an
  accent line under the one open; the wordmark; **Return to Main** while a
  guide is open beside the route; the close chip.
- **Sidebar** (196px, `panel3`). A search box, then the categories --
  Leveling, Dungeons, Class Quests, Professions (each with its badge) and
  Favorites (a gold star) -- then COMING SOON: Reputations, Dailies, Events,
  Gold, Pets & Mounts and Titles, at 45% and not clickable until they have
  guides. Options, at the foot, opens the settings. The open category takes
  `tabbg` and a 3px accent bar.
- **Middle.** A 50px title bar -- a back chevron when there is somewhere to
  go back to, a crumb over the title, and the list's ⋮ -- over the list or
  the Home panels.
- **Right pane** (268px, `panel3`), beside a list: the guide you point at --
  its picture, its name, what it is ("Optimized route", "Dungeon guide"),
  the levels it is for in the colour below, a progress bar with its
  percentage, **Open in a new tab**; the logo and "Pick a
  guide" while you have pointed at none. A line at its foot says what the
  clicks do.

**What it lists** (`GuideBrowser.lua`). Leveling holds Optimized, RestedXP,
RestedXP Hardcore, Zone guides (in Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor) and Custom
zones; a folder of more than 24 guides is split into Levels 1-20, 20-40 and
40-60 by the level each starts at. A zone guide's zone is the one its title
names, or a place in it does ("Coldridge Valley" is Dun Morogh), or else the
one most of its steps' `|Z|` tags name. Dungeons and Class Quests are by
level, Professions and Favorites by name. A route leg that is a dungeon run
-- a title naming a dungeon or raid (`Browser.DungeonIn`), such as
Optimized's Uldaman and Sunken Temple -- is not in its pack's folder but in
**On the routes**, the first folder under Dungeons, each saying whose route it
is on. A pack's attunement or key -- RestedXP's Onyxia Attunement and
Scholomance Key, which have no level range to file them by
(`Browser.AccessChain`) -- is in **Attunements and keys**, the folder after
it. Class Quests holds only yours
(`IsMyClassGuide`: your class's, and one your race has a chain for). Search
looks through every title, any case.

Categories are `GetGuideCategory`'s. Profession guides are named "Alchemy
(1-300)", which matches none of the name prefixes it keys on, so the
category comes off the guide table. Custom zones are matched by name against
`TURTLE_ZONES` in `Core.lua`, which has to name every custom zone --
Scarlet Enclave and Hyjal were once missing and filed with the zone guides;
`Tools/tests/test_guidelist.lua` reads that list out of `Core.lua` and checks
every custom-zone guide against it. `Dungeons/` is taken before a custom
zone's name, so Gilneas City's guide is a dungeon guide, and `Class/` too.
`ParseGuideLevelRange` reads a single `(10)` as 10-10.

**A row** is a folder (its glyph, its name, how many guides it holds) or a
guide: a ring, or a tick once finished; its title without the pack's prefix,
which carries its levels; on the right its progress, or "Your route" for the
main route while you branch. Pointing at a guide marks it (`tabbg`, an
accent bar), shows it on the right, and puts up a star and an arrow on the
row: the star keeps it in Favorites, the arrow opens it in a new tab. A
favourite's star stays up. A click, left or right, opens a guide in a new tab
(or its own tab, if it has one) and leaves the tab you are on alone;
shift-click resets its progress. Picking a guide leaves the route pack alone:
a guide off your route goes on by its own next link. Placeholder guides
carry the grey `TPL` badge.

**The list's ⋮** has four switches, saved per character: colour guides by how
they suit your level (`Theme.LEVEL_COLORS`, the quest log's colours -- grey
once outlevelled, green in range, yellow, orange and red the further short;
none for a profession, whose range is its skill), tick finished guides, hide
finished and outlevelled guides, and star the guides Home suggests. On Home
the ⋮ is which panels show.

**Home** is four panels, two across and two down, the shown ones moving up
into a hidden one's place: **Guides history** (the last five opened, from
`LoadGuide`), **Suggested guides** (the route's next leg, the class quests at
your level, ticked dungeons and custom zones at your level, five at most,
each with why), **Level tracker** (the time at each level, the one you are at
counting up; **See more** is every level) and **Gold tracker** (gold earned
today and this week, in the coins' colours). Time is counted while you play,
from logging in, banked at each level up, loading screen and logout -- not `/played`,
which prints to chat. Gold earned is every rise in your money; spending is
not taken off. Both start from the first time a character runs 0.21.0.

**CURRENT** is the guides open in the guide window, the route first.
**RECENT** is the last 30 opened, under their categories.

**Pictures** (`GuidePictures.lua`), 240x135, the game's art -- the client's
own files, and Turtle WoW's dungeon loading screens, which the client lacks:

- A zone guide shows its zone's map **explored**: the twelve 256px tiles, and
  every area's overlay where pfUI's map reveal data puts it
  (`MapOverlays.lua`, written by `Tools/build/build_map_overlays.py`, MIT,
  Shagu), cut into tiles as the client's `WorldMapFrame_Update` cuts them,
  inside a ScrollFrame that clips them to the picture. The crop is the
  explored areas and a margin at the picture's shape, at least 560 map
  pixels across. A city has no areas and is shown whole. A custom zone
  shows its explored world map as Turtle WoW draws it, which the addon
  carries (`Theme.zonemap`): built from Turtle WoW's tiles and pfUI's
  overlays they came out wrong in game, and pfUI has none for Moonwhisper
  Coast or Scarlet Enclave. The importer leaves those zones' overlays out.
  A custom zone with no map at all shows the logo rather than borrow
  another zone's.
- A dungeon guide, or a route leg named for a dungeon ("Optimized/Uldaman"),
  shows the loading screen Turtle WoW shows on the way in. The 1.12 client
  has no file for most of them, so the addon carries them (`Theme.loadscreen`,
  every dungeon with a guide): the art between the screen's bars,
  below the logo, at 16:9, squeezed into a 256x128 texture and shown whole.
  A dungeon without one, and the raids when they have guides, get the
  instance's own 1.12 screen where there is one, else one of the six generic
  ones chosen from the art (`Pictures.SCREEN_FOR`), cropped to its art.
- A class quest shows the class's crest from the character creation sheet
  in the corner, the panel in the class's colour (`Theme.CLASS_COLORS`), and
  the chain's spell, mount or reward in the middle, else an icon that says
  the class.
- A profession guide shows the profession's icon on its badge's blue.

`Tools/verify.py`'s ban on `Interface\Icons` in shipped code excepts
`GuidePictures.lua`: there the game's art is the picture, not chrome.

### First-time setup -- `SetupFrame.lua`

Not in the concept: RestedXP's first-run questions, over settings the options
panel already has (`routepack`, `UseAH`, `PlayStyle`, `Dungeons`); nothing in
it is a new setting. Opened once per character from the end of
`InitializeRoute` (`MaybeShowSetup`, `db.char.setupdone`), and again from
`/apg setup` or the options panel's **Run setup** pill.

A 420px Chrome window, `SET UP YOUR GUIDE`, with `STEP n OF m` at the right of
the subhead (two steps with dungeons off, three with them on), a display-face
title and a line of intro per step, Back and Continue/Finish at the foot.

1. **Your guide**: a card per route pack this character may use
   (`GetAvailableRoutePacks`) that has a route for its race -- so no RestedXP
   or Hardcore card for a High Elf or Goblin. Name in the display face over a
   line of what it is; the chosen card takes the accent. Picking a pack
   brings its starting features, as the pack pills do.
2. **Features**: `Theme:Switch` rows with a line each. Under them, in gold,
   which of the three the chosen pack's guides do not mark at all
   (`GetPackTags` reads the route's guide text once per pack) -- the
   Optimized guides mark none yet.
3. **Dungeons**: the faction's dungeons (`DUNGEON_INFO`: Ragefire Chasm is
   Horde-only, the Stockade Alliance-only) in level order, each a
   `Theme:StepCheck`, the name, the level range (accent while it is your
   level, gold ahead, dim once past) and how many quests it adds to the route
   (`GetDungeonQuestCount`, from DungeonQuests.lua: "12 quests", "1 quest (+4
   with Deadmines)" while a quest's chain waits on another dungeon, "none in
   this route"), in the accent colour when recommended. Recommended / All /
   None above. Reaching the step with none ticked starts from the recommended
   ones (`GetRecommendedDungeons`): for the pack picked and your race, each
   that adds five quests or more, counting the ones it shares with the others
   recommended. With no quests for any dungeon, a note says the guides take
   you through none yet.

Finish (`ApplySetup`) switches pack only when a different one was chosen --
`SelectRoutePack` re-routes, which would lose your place -- writes the three
filters, re-reads the guide on screen, and prints what was set up. Closing
the window keeps everything and marks setup done.

### Where next? -- `NextGuideFrame.lua`

Not in the concept. Asked when a guide finishes, before the engine moves on:
`UpdateStatusFrame` calls `OfferNextGuide` first, and when it returns true the
guide waits for the answer instead of `LoadNextGuide` or `ReturnFromBranch`.

It is asked only when a custom zone fits (`GetCustomZoneChoices`): a guide in
the `turtle` category, not the one just finished, not finished before
(`db.char.completion`), with the player at least one level short of its bottom
and below its top. Up to five, lowest first. With `offerdungeons` on (the
Dungeons page's *Offer dungeon guides along the way*, off by default, held off
by Solo Self-Found) it is also asked when a dungeon guide fits
(`GetDungeonGuideChoices`): the guide under `Dungeons/` of a ticked dungeon,
vanilla or Turtle WoW's own, fitting the level the same way, up to four,
lowest first. Nothing fits, nothing is asked, and the old path runs. Each
finished guide is asked about once a session.

Chrome with a `WHERE NEXT?` subhead, a line naming what was finished, then:

- **The route** (`Theme:SectionHeader` over a full-width `Theme:PanelButton`):
  "Continue to" the route's next guide (`nextzones`), or, finishing a custom
  zone, "Back to" the route guide for the player's level now
  (`GetOptimizedGuideForLevel`). Hidden at the end of the route.
- **Custom zones**: a button each.
- **Dungeons**: a button each, under the custom zones. Taken like a custom
  zone: from the route it opens in a tab beside it.

Taking a custom zone from the route opens it in a tab (`OpenGuideTab`) and
points tab 1 at the route's next guide, so returning resumes the route rather
than the guide just finished. Taking one from a custom zone replaces that tab
(`LoadGuideInTab`). Going back is `ReturnFromBranch`. Either way the finished
guide is recorded as done. Closing the window (its close chip, Escape) is
"carry on with the route" -- what finishing a guide always did.
`offercustomzones`, on by default, switches it off; it replaced
`autobranch`, a switch that nothing read.

**A dungeon at your level** (`AegisPathfinderMidDungeon`, same file). Not in
the concept. `GetMidLevelDungeons(level)` lists the dungeon guides (`Dungeons/`)
of the ticked dungeons in `DUNGEON_INFO` -- the ones the setup asks about;
Turtle WoW's own start ticked, so they are left to *along the way* -- whose
middle level (`DungeonMidLevel`: `floor((lo + hi + 1) / 2)`, from the guide's
title range) the player has reached, without being past its top, finished
(`db.char.completion`), open in a tab (`FindTab`) or offered before
(`db.char.middungeonsoffered[code]`). Nothing before `setupdone`, in Solo
Self-Found, or with `middungeons` false (the Dungeons page's *Offer a dungeon's
guide at the middle of its levels*, on by default). Up to four, lowest middle
first.

`OfferMidLevelDungeons(level)` shows them: chrome with an `A DUNGEON AT YOUR
LEVEL` subhead, a line naming the level and the dungeon, a `Theme:PanelButton`
per dungeon ("Open ..." when there is one) and a **Not now** button. Showing
them is the offer: each is marked offered then, whatever the answer. A button
opens its guide in a tab (`OpenGuideTab`) and the window keeps the rest; Not
now, the close chip or Escape closes it. It waits while Where next?, the setup
or the class quest's window is up, without marking anything. It is asked from
its own `PLAYER_LEVEL_UP` frame (`arg1`, the new level: `UnitLevel` can lag),
at the end of `InitializeRoute`, and when the setup is finished (`SetupStep`),
each through `OfferAtLevel`. Beside the guide, as Where next? is.

**A class quest at your level** (`AegisPathfinderClassQuest`, same file). Not
in the concept. The same window as the dungeon's (`BuildOffer`, `PaintOffer`,
`ShowOffer`, one layout for both; a row is anchored to its own window, which
`Put` now takes), with an `A CLASS QUEST AT YOUR LEVEL` subhead.
`GetClassMilestones(level)` reads `CLASS_MILESTONES`, which each
`Guides/Class/` file fills through `RegisterClassMilestones(side, class,
list)`: for your side and `UnitClass` token, the milestones your race
(`ClassGuideRace`: `UnitRace`'s token, Scourge as Undead) has a chain for,
whose level you have reached, by no more than five (`CLASS_PAST`), and that
are not offered before
(`db.char.classoffered[guide]`), finished (`db.char.completion`), done on the
server (`IsQuestCompletedOnServer` of the race's `last`), open in a tab, or
still to come on your route (`RouteHasQuests`: a leg from the one in tab 1 on
has a `|QID|` of the race's chain in a step your class and race would see, each
guide read once). A `group` milestone only in Group mode without Solo
Self-Found. Nothing before `setupdone` or with `classquests` false (Step Display's
*Offer class quests at their level*, on by default). Up to four, lowest level
first. `OfferClassMilestones` shows them, marking each offered;
`OpenClassMilestone` opens one in a tab, and the guide's end takes you back
to the route as any tab's does. `OfferAtLevel` asks the dungeon's first; the
dungeon window's `OnHide` then asks the class quest's.

### Shopping list -- `MaterialsFrame.lua`

Not in the concept, which is leveling-focused. It exists because the
profession guides need it: the reference document prints one shopping list per
profession totalled from skill 1, which is the wrong number for anyone
part-way through, since it counts reagents for crafts already done. The panel
totals what the *remaining* steps call for.

Opened by the **Shopping list** button at the left of the objectives panel's
footer -- the buy glyph and the words, shown only on a guide with `|MATS|`
tags (`GuideHasMaterials`). It used to be a bare glyph named `"use"`, which is
not one of the theme's glyphs, so it drew nothing at all. It pops out beside
the guide, on whichever side has room, like the options panel, until dragged;
a dragged position is restored (it used to be saved and never read).

- **Chrome**: the standard header and a `SHOPPING LIST` subhead, 280px wide.
- **Scope tabs** (`Theme:Tab`): *This step* -- the first unfinished step from
  the current one on that lists reagents -- and *Whole route*. Remembered in
  `profile.shoppingscope`; the whole route by default.
- **Summary**: the craft's title or the guide's name, then "4 of 5 still to
  get", or "all 5 in your bags".
- **Rows**: have/need (`display` 11, "20/40", capped at the need) then the
  name. Gold for a line still short, the accent with a dimmed name for one
  covered. Up to 14 rows, never fewer than 3; the window is sized to its list
  and the theme's scroll bar takes over past 14. Sorted alphabetically: it is
  a list you read while hunting for one item, and one sorted by what is short
  would move lines under the cursor as you buy.
- **Bag counts** are by name over bags 0-4. `BAG_UPDATE` only marks the list
  stale; the window repaints from OnUpdate at most every 0.25s, and only while
  open, so a loot or a stack split is one repaint, not one per bag.
- **Send to Exchange** and **Cheapest route** (`Theme:PanelButton`, half the
  width each, at the foot). Exchange is below; Cheapest route opens the
  crafting route window.

Nothing in it is profession-specific -- any guide carrying `|MATS|` tags gets
a shopping list.

#### Aegis: Exchange

Exchange builds its own shopping list from crafting projects, `{ name, itemId,
made, want, reagents = { { name, count, itemId } } }`, priced at the auction
house. The button writes one project per craft still ahead, in route order
with the next craft on top: `want` is the craft count and `made` is 1, so
Exchange's `reagent count x crafts` lands on the same totals as the list here
(`Tools/tests/test_materials.lua` checks this against the Alchemy guide's own
steps, multiplied out). The same craft on two steps is one project with both counts.
Item ids come from the bags, then Exchange's own name map, then pfQuest's item
database; anything unmatched is reported in chat, since Exchange's list only
shows reagents it can resolve.

Only Exchange's public calls are used -- `craft.Projects`, `AddProject`,
`DeleteProject` and `ui.RefreshCraft` (pcall-guarded). Sent projects carry
`pathfinder = <guide>`, which is how they are found to update or remove.
Exchange keeps one project per name, so one of the player's own recipes that
shares a name with a craft on the route is kept inside ours as `replaced` and
put back when ours goes; its exact item ids are used meanwhile.

It follows the guide: `UpdateStatusFrame` calls `RefreshShoppingList` when
the step settles, which marks things stale for one OnUpdate, and
`SyncExchange` rewrites Exchange's list only if what is left has changed.
Finishing the route removes it. It only syncs while the guide it was sent
from is the one loaded. Exchange's demo mode shows made-up projects in place
of the saved list, so nothing is sent or removed while it is on.

### Crafting route -- `CraftRouteFrame.lua`

Not in the concept. It does what CraftRoute does, without CraftRoute: plans
the cheapest way from your skill to 300 at today's prices and shows it, and
can turn it into a guide. The planning is `CraftPlanner.lua`, the auction scan
`CraftScan.lua`, the recipe and merchant-price data `Crafting/` (converted from
CraftRoute's data by `Tools/build/import_recipes.py`).

Opened by **Cheapest route** on the shopping list, or `/apg craft`. It pops out
beside the guide like the shopping list, until dragged (`craftframe`).

- **Chrome**: the standard header and a `CRAFTING ROUTE` subhead, 360px wide.
- **Profession** (`Theme:Dropdown`): every profession with recipe data, with
  your skill beside the ones you have. It opens on the profession of the guide
  you are reading, else the last one planned, else the first you have. At the
  right, `SKILL 41 TO 300` (`display` 12, dim): from your current skill to
  where the route gets.
- **Total** (`display` 18, gold) and the crafts beside it. A route that pays for
  itself by selling back shows `+` and the amount in the accent, and says so.
- **Breakdown** (`body` 10, dim): reagents, recipes, what is sold back, how many
  items have no price, and where the route stops if it stops short.
- **Status line**: where auction prices come from ("your scan 2 h ago and Aegis:
  Exchange"), or gold when there are none or some reagents have no price, or the
  scan's progress while it runs.
- **Rows**, two lines each, 30px, eight visible and the theme's scroll bar past
  that: the skill band (`display` 11, accent), the recipe, the crafts (`x49`,
  gold); under them the reagents of one craft and what the step spends. A step
  with an unpriced reagent is gold. Hovering a row shows the expected crafts,
  the cost of one, how the recipe is learned, what to buy, what is made first,
  and what has no price.
- **Sell what is left over to a merchant** (`Theme:Switch`): whether leftovers
  count against the cost. `char.craftsellback`, on by default.
- **Scan prices** / **Stop scan** and **Load as guide** (`Theme:PanelButton`,
  half width each).

The plan is worked out when the window opens and again only when something it
depends on changes: the profession, your skill, the sell-back switch, a
finished scan, or a recipe newly seen in your profession window. Scan progress
only repaints. Each of those arrives as a dirty flag flushed once on the next
frame.

#### The planner

1. Unit costs: the lower of a merchant's price and the auction house's, or the
   cost of making the item from its own reagents where this profession can and
   that is cheaper.
2. Skill-up chance: certain from orange to yellow, then falling in a straight
   line to nothing at grey.
3. The route: a dynamic program over skill points with the last recipe used as
   the state. Carrying on costs the next point (a craft's cost over its chance);
   switching also costs the new recipe's fee, and one craft as a nudge against
   one-point detours.
4. Depth: the route is priced at the quantities it buys, walking up the
   auction listings, and planned again at those prices until it settles.
5. Accounting: the route is played through in order -- an earlier step's
   products are used by a later one before anything is bought -- and what is
   left is sold back if the switch says so.

A known recipe is free to learn; a drop or reputation recipe is only planned
once known; `skip` recipes (cooldowns, rare drops) never. A reagent with no
price keeps its recipe out, unless the route cannot go on without it, in which
case the route uses it, says which items have no price, and leaves them out of
the total rather than guessing.

#### Auction prices

`CraftScan.lua` searches for each reagent and recipe book the profession could
use that no merchant sells -- the route's own first -- one name at a time, gated
on `CanSendAuctionQuery()`, reading `AUCTION_ITEM_LIST_UPDATE` only while a
reply is awaited, up to four pages an item, and keeping only listings with
exactly the name searched for. Each item's listings are stored cheapest first
per realm (`realm.craftprices`), so forty units are priced as forty. Items
searched in the last half hour are skipped. Aegis: Exchange's unit price is
used where there is no scan of our own, or ours is over a week old.

#### Load as guide

The route becomes a QuestShell+ guide, `<Profession> (cheapest route)`, in the
Professions list. The authored profession guide's non-craft steps -- trainers
per rank, the level each rank needs, the Expert cookbook, the Artisan quest --
are kept, each block placed where the old skill cap runs out (the rank to 150
at 75, and so on); crafts are split there. Craft steps carry `|SKILL|`,
`|CRAFT|` and `|MATS|` like authored ones, so they complete on your skill and
feed the shopping list; a trainer recipe you do not know carries your
faction's trainers. The guide is saved in `char.craftguides` and registered
again at login, and loading a new plan replaces it.

### Active Items, Active Targets and Macros -- `ActiveFrames.lua`

Not in the concept: RestedXP's two small windows, asked for by name. Each is a
`Theme:Panel` with an 18px `Theme:Header` strip carrying its title (`ACTIVE
ITEMS`, `ACTIVE TARGETS`, `display` 11) in place of the wordmark, and a row of
32px tiles -- the theme's rounded square, `panel-2` fill, a hairline border
that takes the accent on hover. The width fits the tiles or the title,
whichever is wider. `MEDIUM` strata, not `DIALOG`: they are part of the HUD,
not windows that stack.

Until dragged, Items hangs under the guide (`TOPRIGHT` to its `BOTTOMRIGHT`,
6px down) and Targets under Items -- or under the guide while Items has
nothing to show. Dragged by the title, each is saved (`activeitems`,
`activetargets`) and stays; Reset Panels forgets both. A window mid-drag is
not re-anchored by a repaint. Each hides when it has nothing to show, and the
options panel can switch either off (`showactiveitems`, `showactivetargets`).

**Items** replaced the single floating use-item button. A tile per item the
guide wants used, up to six, one per item however many steps want it: the
current step's `|U|` item first, then any other step's whose quest is in the
log and not complete. Only what is in the bags -- a tile for an item you do
not carry is a dead button. The icon is the bag's, cropped of its bevel; a
stack shows its count in the corner; hover is `GameTooltip:SetBagItem`. A
click uses it from wherever it is now, and ticks the current step if that is
a USE step for this item.

**Targets**: a tile per NPC or enemy the current step wants found, up to four.
From the step's `|NPC|` tag, and from pfQuest's database by the step's quest
id: an ACCEPT's starters, a TURNIN's enders, a COMPLETE's objective units then
the units that drop its objective items, likeliest drop first. A COMPLETE's
units are narrowed to those with a pfQuest spawn in the first of the step's
`|Z|` zone, the guide's zone, then the player's (`Nearby`) that has any, and
are left whole when none does: by drop chance alone Crocolisk Hunting targeted
Wetlands and Stranglethorn crocolisks, never a Loch Crocolisk. pfQuest's
`fac` string says who is friendly to the player's faction. The tile shows the
step's action glyph (the kill glyph in `danger` for an enemy) and, in its
corner, the raid mark it will apply -- the one piece of Blizzard art here,
because it is the in-game marker itself. A click targets the next one by
that name around you (**Cycling**, below) and `SetRaidTarget`s the entry's
context mark (quest icons, below). An existing mark is not set again (which
would toggle it off). The tile of whoever is targeted takes the accent border,
relit on `PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED`.

**Cycling.** `TargetByName` -- `/target` -- takes the nearest with the name
but keeps the current target when it has the name already, so pressing it
again never moves on. With ClassicAPI's `TargetNearest`, `UnitGUID` and
`TargetUnit`, a press looks round instead: up to 30 `TargetNearest` calls,
stopping at the first GUID seen twice, keep the living non-player units with
a wanted name, sorted by `UnitDistanceSquared`, and the press takes the one
after the current target's GUID -- the nearest when the target is none of
them -- so presses go nearest, next out, and round again. While it looks,
the `PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED` handler does nothing (no marks, no border
repaints) for the units it passes. When it finds none of them, the target is
put back (`TargetUnit` of the old GUID, or `ClearTarget`) and it falls back to
`TargetByName`, which also reaches friendly NPCs further out. Without those
ClassicAPI functions it is `TargetByName` alone, as it was.

**Quest icons.** Each target carries a context and the mark that says it,
as RestedXP's Quest Icons do: `talk` star (an ACCEPT's starters, a TURNIN's
enders, `|NPC|` names), `interact` square (a friendly objective unit), `kill`
skull (a hostile objective unit), `loot` cross (a unit that drops an
objective item). pfQuest's `fac` decides friend from enemy; at marking time a
`kill` or `loot` unit that `UnitCanAttack` says cannot be attacked gets the
square. On `UPDATE_MOUSEOVER_UNIT` and `PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED` the unit
(`mouseover`, `target`) is marked if its name is wanted: the current step's
targets first, then, for each quest in the log (ids from ClassicAPI's
`C_QuestLog.GetQuestIDForLogIndex`, headers skipped), an unfinished quest's
COMPLETE targets or a finished one's TURNIN targets, up to 40 names, rebuilt
on every repaint. Never over an existing mark, on a player or a corpse, or in
a raid. `questicons` switches it off. The step's targets are worked out
whether or not the Targets window is showing: the icons and the macro use
them too.

**Macros**, the third window, under Targets (or whichever is showing above
it), with a tile for each of two character macros the addon writes and keeps
current -- RestedXP's generated targeting macro, plus one for the quest item:

- **AegisTarget**: `/apg target` (`TargetNextActive`), the same on every
  step: each press the next of the step's targets around you, marked
  (**Cycling**). It was a `/target <name>` line per target and `/script
  AegisPathfinder:MarkTarget()`; `/target` stayed on whoever was targeted, so
  presses did not move on. `MarkTarget` stays for a macro saved that way until
  it is next written. With no targets it says there is nobody. Its icon is
  Hunter's Mark's (`Ability_Hunter_SniperShot`).
- **AegisItem**: `/apg useitem` (1.12 has no `/use`), wearing the first active
  item's icon. The stock action bars repaint a button when its slot changes, not
  when the macro in it does, so after an edit the addon repaints any stock
  button holding it (`ActionButton_Update`); other bar addons repaint on
  their own schedule.

**Icons by name.** ClassicAPI's `C_Macro.CreateMacro` / `C_Macro.EditMacro`
take the icon as a texture name, so both macros are written through them when
they are there: no list is involved, and AegisItem gets its item's own icon,
which the stock list lacks. The stock `CreateMacro` / `EditMacro` take a place
in the macro icon list instead, and the client fills that list lazily: read
while it was still empty, and kept, it left AegisTarget with the first place
of an empty list, a blank icon. Without `C_Macro` the list is read again
until it is the one the client reports, and the icon is left alone while it
is empty; the targeting icon is then the first of Hunter's Mark's, the town
watch's or a spyglass the list has, and AegisItem's the item's icon when the
list has it, else the question mark.

Both are made as character macros the first time there is something for them
to do, and rewritten (`EditMacro`, only when the text or icon changed) on
every repaint after that -- including a step with nothing to do, so one on a
bar never aims at a finished step. Never while `MacroFrame` is open: the stock
UI saves its own copy of the text over ours when it closes, so the repaint
waits a second and tries again. With the 18 character slots full nothing is
made; the tile's tooltip and a drag say so. A tile click does what its macro
does (`TargetNextActive`, `UseActiveItem`); a drag is `PickupMacro`, to drop
on a bar. `showmacros` switches the window and the macro writing off.

`/apg target` and a key binding (`Bindings.xml`) do what AegisTarget does:
the nearest of the step's targets, then the next one out on each press --
RestedXP's macro, without a macro. `/apg useitem` and a second binding use the
first item.

Step changes repaint on the next frame (`UpdateStatusFrame` calls
`RefreshActiveFrames`); `BAG_UPDATE` bursts coalesce into one repaint 0.25s
later.

### Scrollbar -- `Theme:ScrollBar`

A dark track, a stadium
thumb (`scroll-thumb.tga`, radius half its width, so the caps stay circular at
any length) and caret step buttons. It is still a Slider, so
`SetMinMaxValues` / `SetValue` / `OnValueChanged` are unchanged.

The carets move by the bar's `step` -- a row by default, three rows in the
guide browser, 40px in the error log -- and stop at the ends of the range. Every
scrolling list uses it: the objectives panel, the options body, the guide
browser, the shopping list and the error log. The last three were still on
`UIPanelScrollBarTemplate` / `UIPanelScrollFrameTemplate`, which drew
Blizzard's gold arrows and knob; `Tools/verify.py` now fails on either.

### Objectives panel tab bar -- `ObjectivesFrame.lua`

One tab per open guide, up to eight. Tab 1 is the main route — what
auto-advance follows. Every tab has a ✕, the first included; closing the last
one leaves the panel empty, with "Click here to load a guide" in place of the
steps. Clicking a tab switches to it and resumes where it was left; the `+`
opens the guide browser beside the panel; at eight the `+` stops offering what it
cannot do.

The bar does not squeeze every open guide in: at five that reduced each tab to
"Optim…". It shows as many as fit at 100px or more, four at most (three at the
concept's 396px, four once the panel is widened to about 480px), and a `‹` `›` pair appears either side
once there are more. Each arrow, or a notch of the mouse wheel over the bar,
moves the view one tab and dims at its end. The view follows the active tab
when that changes — opening a guide, switching from the guide browser, closing
one — and otherwise stays where the arrows left it, so a repaint does not
yank it back. Tab labels drop the pack prefix (`Optimized/`) that every tab
shares; the tooltip keeps the full name. Below 130px a tab drops its badge so
the width goes to the name.

**Substitution: the badge says what the guide is** (`GuideBadge`,
`Theme.BADGES`). The concept has the one gold `XP`. Here it's `XP` for a leveling
guide, `PF` (blue) for a profession guide, a crafting route included, `DG`
(violet) for a dungeon guide, `CL` (teal) for a class quest guide, `HC` (red,
light text) for a hardcore guide, and the grey `TPL` for a placeholder,
whatever else it is. PF, DG, CL and HC keep their colours in every theme, as
the step bands do.

The model is `db.char.tabs` (a list of `{guide, step}`) plus `activetab`, in
`Core.lua`. It replaced a one-deep branch — main plus at most one branch off
it — and the old `isbranching` / `branchsavedguide` / `branchsavedstep` fields
are still written, derived from the tabs by `SyncBranchState`, because a dozen
call sites read them and "am I branching?" is just "is the active tab not the
first one?". A character saved under the old model migrates on first use.

Tabs are a fixed pool of frames, anchored as they come into view, so switching
guides or scrolling the bar never creates a frame.

### Still to do

Every surface in the concept is now built. What remains is verification: none
of it has been loaded in a client.

## Verification

`Tools/verify.py` checks every texture is a 32-bit RLE TGA with power-of-two
dimensions and bottom-left origin — the format matching the two textures the
addon already shipped and which are known to load on this client.

`Tools/verify.py` also fails the build on Blizzard chrome -- `SetBackdrop`,
`TooltipBorderBG`, dialog/checkbox/button art, `GameFont` objects -- across
every shipped file, so a panel drifting off the theme is caught here rather
than in the client.

The Lua tests under `Tools/tests/` execute the real code against a stubbed API
and assert the geometry and state transitions.

**None of this proves the UI looks like the concept.** Nothing here has been
loaded in a game client. Texture orientation, font rendering, and whether the
nine-slice corners line up are all unverified.
